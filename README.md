# webpack-vue-template

这是一个使用 Vue CLI 创建出来的 Vue 项目基础结构，有所不同的是，我删除了一些关于 webpack 的配置，还有路由等。

这个模板主要是为了这个[issue](https://github.com/Aisen60/blog/issues/15)做准备的。

**项目目录结构：**

```
webpack-vue-template ·································
   ├─ public ·········································
   │  └─ favicon.ico ·································
   ├─ src ············································
   │  ├─ assets ······································
   │  |  └─ logo.png ·································
